REPLACE MILLION COORD VARIABLES FOR A SINGLE STRUCT
write update_game_state function (src/tetric.c)

for later:
- score system
- levels system
- increase falling speed according to current level
- configs menu (change controls)
- improve rotation system
  - wall kick
  - maybe full blown SRS? (way in the future)
